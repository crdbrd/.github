## This is Cardboard

Hi! We're the Cardboard product team 👋

We started Cardboard to make the management of your
SaaS subscriptions and marketing spend enjoyable.
Paying with the shared company card, hunting for receipts,
and wasting hours on accounting every month belongs to the past.

If that is music in your ears,
go check us out at [cardboard.inc](https://cardboard.inc)!

### Open Source 💕

While building Cardboard,
we're doing so on the shoulders of giants,
using a plethora of open source software.

To us, it is a given that we should give back to the community,
and help others build on top of our shoulders.
As Cardboard is an early-stage startup,
we can't responsibly spend much time on open-sourcing,
but we'll share what we can,
a bit at a time. 🐢
